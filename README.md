# The Fresh-shop

## Mission objectives
In this challenge, I have to implement as many back-end functionalities as possible in OOP. 

## Description
Freshshop is your new customer. They specialize in organic food and biodegradable bikes. Their store in Saint-Gilles is so profitable that they've opened another just below Thomas's apartment. To celebrate, they want to launch an e-commerce website at the same time.

Freshshop already owns the frontend part of the project. You must now implement the back-end with NodeJS or Php in OOP.
